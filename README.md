# Viaplay Keyboard Shortcuts (Chrome Extension)

![](project-logo-viaplay-shortcuts.png)

Viaplay is a streaming service with very limited hotkey functionality. This unpacked Chrome extension aims to solve that problem.

(PS. There is also one [one for Telia TV](https://github.com/Hamatti/teliatv-keyboard-shortcuts))

## How to use?

It's currently an unpacked extension so download and unzip it into a folder. Then open your Google Chrome, go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), enable Developer mode from the toggle and select "Load unpacked" and navigate to the folder you unzipped it into.

Now whenever you navigate to [viaplay.fi](https://viaplay.fi) and start playing a video, the new keyboard shortcuts will be available.

Now with cross-browser compatibility! Simply create a bookmarklet an load it whenever you visit a viaplay domain. Paste the contents of `bookmarklet` into a new bookmark in the `url` field and the extension will be loaded.

## Note

Please note that this extension is not affiliated, endorsed or supported by Viaplay or Viasat. It is a hobby project built by users.
